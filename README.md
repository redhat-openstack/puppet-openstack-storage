openstack-gluster
=================

Use the Foreman/Puppet to end-to-end provision Gluster-backed OpenStack storage controllers for Cinder, Glance and Swift (.. or at least that's the idea).
This will be utilized to provision bare-metal nodes as GlusterFS storage controllers via the Foreman and puppet.
